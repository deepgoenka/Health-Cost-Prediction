# Health Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting health costs using Linear Regression. The goal of this project is to estimate the healthcare costs for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more. It can be a valuable tool for insurance companies, healthcare providers, and individuals to estimate and plan for medical expenses.

## Features
- Predicts healthcare costs for individuals based on a set of input features.
- Uses a simple yet effective Linear Regression model.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for making cost predictions.
- Includes the ability to visualize predictions and model performance.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available healthcare dataset, which can be found [here](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/health-costs/insurance.csv). The dataset includes information about individuals' demographics, habits, and healthcare costs.

## Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. Install the required packages.
6. Run the application.
   
## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use it to predict health costs by following these steps.
1. Enter the required information for an individual's health cost prediction, such as Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoking status and Region.
2. Based on the information given, the model will estimated health cost for that individual.

## Model Training
To understand how the Linear Regression model was trained and explore the feature selection process, refer to the model training section in the documentation.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the prediction model and understand its limitations, consult the evaluation section in the documentation.
